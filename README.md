## Running Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the test runner.  
To run the tests and generate coverage reports, you can use the following commands:

1. To run the tests use:  
   `npm run test`  
   After running the tests, you can view the test results in the terminal
2. To run tests and generate coverage report use:  
   `npm run test:cover`  
   The coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory (ignored by git). Open the file `index.html` within `coverage/lcov-report/` directory in your browser to view detailed coverage information and discover which parts of code are covered by the tests
